# 5 Lines I Couldn't Draw

* <insert perl humor>
* "Wow. that sounds awful"
* "Its fine"
* "alert on the derivative of the message volume per sec"
* now emails are not alerts, they're signal.
* Cognitive leap of monitoring tools as signal for state of the system
* one of 5 lines.
* I was carrying a misapprehension about what monitoring was and whom it was for
* "Monitoring is the thing that makes alerts happen" is a fallacy ***
* Always an ad-hoc, and prescriptive in the wrong direction.
* "Monitoring is not FOR alerting".  Not about uptime.
* "Nobody OWNS monitoring"
* "Everyone owns monitoring"
* "Everyone can measure things... Everyone who cares, gets to measure"
* Success because expectations change.
* "What if I told you: You might be fascinated with anomaly detection because
  your input signal sucks"
* Complexity isolates.  Those alerts are the sword ops dies on.  So don't.
* Rate limiting - Post:  There is no data available at this time interval
    * Librato limits metrics ingest to save bill of customer.
* Cynefin  Chaotic -> Complex -> Complicated -> obvious --->
    * Things you need to move:
        * Control
        * understanding
        * standardization
* "I thought complexity was my lot of life" Me dissecting somebody's JS circa
  2003.
* Pain of ops isolates ops from larger world.
* Work to reduce complexity... and monitoring helps simplify.
    * helps you find the 1-3 metrics you actually care about.  
* Person who curated the view of awesome isn't the person who collected the
  metrics.
* Other people help you build the bridge to understanding
* Teams need to share metrics.  Publish them internally.
* "Everyone gets to measure things, no one owns monitoring"
* "I was alone with my pain, despite being surrounded by engineer"
* "Someone else's problem" does not exist
* "Effective Telemetry + people measuring things = better culture"
* They want to comprehend the Y-Axis of your win.
