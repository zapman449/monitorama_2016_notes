### Spam Management and demand control in monitoring systems By Scott Franklin
* Growth of metrics is a thing
* < 1% of data is queried
* Non queried data can still be valuable
* Slicing during debugging
* data often only useful during outages
* Some data is terrible in datastores
* facebook system:
    * No registration
        * only require tag with team name
    * restrict only to keep system healthy
    * audit after the fact
* Protect the system from users
* Protect users from each other.
* track resource usage per team
    * teams can raise their own limits
* system floats up new metrics.  And generates a regex which matches all of them.
* (track things which are read, vs not read)
* 3 clicks and your new metric is blacklisted.
* Big spike, low priority alert.  Bigger spike, on-call alert.
* Cut growth by 60%
* Didn't get in the way of people doing their job.  Didn't stop honest players.

### Shmarallel, Shmostulate By Dan Slimmon
@danslimmon
* Euclid proved a bunch of stuff about geometry
* Or that's what he thought.
* A postulate is something you know to be true.

* 2000 years to fix the 5th postulate
* Non-euclidian geometry solved 5th postulate. Euclidian is first 4.
* Math isn't about picking real objects and studying them
* You choose the definitions you WANT and study the results. ###

### The benefits of a systems lens by Jason Hand
@jasonhand
* Viewing feedback from a "systems thinking" model
* Research in bias
* System: interacting or interdependent components for a complex 'whole'
* Feedback: Giving  and receiving
* Systems thinking:
* Correct the skew of any single perspective
* 5 benefits:
    * Accuracy
    * Judgement
        * Discard needless judgement
    * Enhance accountability & Responsibility
    * avoid blame
    * Avoid fixes that fail (temp fixes)
* 3 questions:
    * Difference between giver and receiver
    * Ask what is the roll?
    * Are process or policies causing friction to feedback?

### Hosted Graphite By Charlie
* Protect your lizard brain from on-call
* Amazon burns people out like "little tea lights"
* Let's not follow that example
* 5 things:
    * Hire more people
    * Pay attention to unused holiday days.  Consider forcing people to
      take breaks
    * Encourage evening and weekend disconnections
        * Don't work more hours than needed.
    * Best effort on-call support for (New Feature) (or business hours)
    * Our on-call shifts are weekly... end on Friday morning, and you get
      the rest of the day off.
        * tried as an experiment, works very well
        * Quotes:
            * "Makes on-call almost bearable"
            * "Allows for a clean break before your weekend"
            * "Friday morning sleep in allows for healthy weekend"
        * Scales with team size... cheaper as team grows
        * Hiring benefits.
    * Manager on-call: Does it blind manager to forest level issues if they're
      feeling the pain of the trees?
        * manager with no on-call experience is probably worse though.
