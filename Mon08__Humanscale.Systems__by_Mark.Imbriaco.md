# Humanscale Systems

* #Monitoringsucks old meme
* "I proposed that monitoring sucks, but it's improving.  the tools we have
   today are better than we had a year ago. Composability is vital to providing
   the tools that are flexible enough for a wide variety of businesses."
   - Jason Dixon
* Gave birth to #monitoringlove
* It's about the people.
* Don't ask me to define DevOps
* DevOps helped fix culture, but it leads us astray... "The tools don't matter"
  is an anti-pattern.
* If the tech didn't matter, we'd do something else... which would be less
  stressful.
* We sweat the details, (ok, it's partially because we're OCD.  don't judge us)
* "All software is horrible".  
* Humans are fallible... and at 3am, they're more so.
* We have a Complex Socio-technical System
* Problem is when we believe we can anticipate every failure mode of our systems
* "Human Practitioners are the adaptable element of [unadaptable] complex systems"
  -Dr. Richard L. Cook
* (aka the automation handles the boring failures)
* "DevOps (n): The practice of spending countless hours appeasing automation
  tools because of a fear of shell scripts, SSH, and for loops." - Mark Imbriaco
* Think about the interface and the interactions... especially the human ones
* Give some time to our human interactions... even a fraction of the time given
  to API design ***
* Think about the intent.  Think how you might want to interrogate a component
  of your system
* Think about likely scenarios thing obvious and easy, and the unlikely possible.
* Consistency matters.  Build tools that work with humans ability for muscle memory
* will it blend?  Will it work with other tools that are similar in pipeline?
* If something could be tricky, offer a --dry-run mode.
