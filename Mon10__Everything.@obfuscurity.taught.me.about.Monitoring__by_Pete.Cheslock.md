@petecheslock

* Amazing time to work in tech.
* The old days sucked.  No good old days.
* _The first fifteen lives of Harry August_ by Claire North
* Rewind to 1999
    * sysadmin in 99, with cd and ls
    * `# chown -Rf bob:bob files /`
    * Phone ring as alerting mechanism.
    * Cold Fusion was advanced.
    * MRTG
    * Then Cacti
    * `* * * * * /scripts/mrtg-netmon` which doesn't talk to mrtg
    * Then cron with 10 second sleep increments...
* Bespoke monitoring is a luxury can't be afforded by a startup
* What would nagios tell us?  Everything is effed.
* I want to build and ship my own tech debt for once
* You don't get to choose when you launch, nor when you scale
* Monitor syscall events.  Unpredictable load.
* Security company: can't go down.
* Premature optimization is the root of all evil...
* "I think self-hosted metrics are going to be comas archaic as running your own
  postfix/imap over the next few years." #mipsytipsy
* threat stack started with 60 second aggregation.  Now, less. (ie 10sec agg)
* https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize easy button for graphite
* Want your devs to ops?  Build consumable services.
* Devs need to own their dashboards.
* "There's technical debt, then there's technical subprime mortgages with
  exploding ballon payments." @markimbriaco
* If you're not embarrassed, you're not devopsing hard enough.
* this tool choice matters not to your customer.  Barely matters to you.
* Community matters, relationships matter.  Tech matters less.
* You are (probably) not google.  Don't solve their problem. ###
* Solve for your problems, today.
* No excuse for having no metrics or telemetry.  Pick something and use it.
